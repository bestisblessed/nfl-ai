'''
Bootstrap Grid System
Bootstrap is a grid-based layout system that divides the page into 12 columns. The dbc.Row creates horizontal sections, while dbc.Col specifies how much of the row width each component should take up.

Code Breakdown:
dbc.Row: Defines a new row on the page. Rows ensure that columns are aligned horizontally.
dbc.Col: Defines columns inside the row. The width argument specifies how many of the 12 available columns the component should occupy.
For example, dbc.Col(dcc.Graph(figure=heatmap_fig), width=6) means the heatmap will take up 6 out of 12 columns, and the radar chart next to it will also take 6 out of 12 columns, making them side-by-side with equal width.
