    "# Offensive vs Defensive Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Man-to-Man Defense vs. Pass-Heavy Offense:\n",
    "Strengths: Man coverage can effectively neutralize receivers, forcing the quarterback to make precise throws. It can also disrupt timing-based passing attacks and limit big plays.\n",
    "Weaknesses: If the pass rush is not effective, the defense may struggle to cover receivers for an extended period, leading to potential big gains for the offense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Zone Defense vs. Spread Offense:\n",
    "Strengths: Zone coverage can provide better overall field coverage, making it difficult for the offense to exploit specific matchups. It can also force the quarterback to make difficult reads.\n",
    "Weaknesses: Against a spread offense with quick, precise passes, zone coverage may leave gaps in the defense, allowing the offense to find open receivers easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Blitzing Defense vs. Strong Pocket Passer:\n",
    "Strengths: Blitzing can put significant pressure on the quarterback, forcing quicker throws and disrupting the passing game.\n",
    "Weaknesses: A strong pocket passer may exploit the blitz by quickly identifying and targeting hot routes or by releasing the ball before the pressure arrives, potentially leading to big plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Conservative Defense vs. Run-Heavy Offense:\n",
    "Strengths: A conservative defense can focus on stopping the run and limiting big plays. It can also maintain gap discipline, making it harder for the offense to gain significant yardage on the ground.\n",
    "Weaknesses: Against a potent run-heavy offense, a conservative defense may struggle to consistently stop the run and may get worn down over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Play-Action Offense vs. Aggressive Defense:\n",
    "Strengths: An offense that effectively uses play-action can catch aggressive defenders out of position, creating opportunities for big plays downfield.\n",
    "Weaknesses: An aggressive defense that bites on play-action fakes can leave open passing lanes and vulnerable to deep passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Power Running Offense vs. Blitzing Defense:\n",
    "Strengths: A power running offense can wear down a blitzing defense and exploit the gaps created by defenders leaving their positions.\n",
    "Weaknesses: Blitzing defenders can penetrate the backfield quickly and disrupt the running game, leading to tackles for loss or minimal gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. West Coast Offense vs. Man Coverage Defense:\n",
    "Strengths: The West Coast offense's quick, short passing game can create separation from man coverage defenders and lead to yards after the catch.\n",
    "Weaknesses: If the man coverage defenders are physical and jam receivers at the line of scrimmage, it can disrupt the timing of West Coast plays."

    "To go deeper with the analysis, you can explore several advanced metrics, comparisons, and visualizations. Here are some ideas for enhancing the depth of your insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Contextual Factors - Analyze ATS after Loss Streaks**:\n",
    "   - Analyze whether teams that are on a **losing streak** tend to break out of that streak (by winning ATS) or if they tend to continue struggling. This adds another layer of context to understanding teams’ resilience.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df_filtered['Loss Streak'] = df_filtered.groupby('Team')['ATS Losses After Loss'].cumsum()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Filter out teams with significant loss streaks and see how they recover\n",
    "   streak_performance = df_filtered[df_filtered['Loss Streak'] > 1].groupby('Team').sum()\n",
    "   streak_performance['Win Percentage After Streak'] = streak_performance['ATS Wins After Loss'] / (streak_performance['ATS Wins After Loss'] + streak_performance['ATS Losses After Loss'])\n",
    "   display(streak_performance[['Win Percentage After Streak']])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Analysis**: This approach highlights whether teams tend to break out of bad streaks and recover ATS after multiple losses or if they are more likely to continue struggling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Correlation Analysis with Point Differentials**:\n",
    "   - Investigate whether there's a correlation between **point differential** (the margin by which a team loses) and their ATS performance after a loss. This could reveal if teams that lose by big margins tend to bounce back more strongly or continue to struggle.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Assuming the dataset has Point Differential after losses\n",
    "   correlation = df_filtered[['ATS Wins After Loss', 'Point Differential']].corr()\n",
    "   display(correlation)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Analysis**: You could discover whether teams that lose close games are more likely to cover the spread next time, compared to teams that lose by large margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Cluster Teams by Performance Profiles**:\n",
    "   - Using machine learning techniques like **clustering** (e.g., K-Means), group teams into clusters based on their ATS performance after losses and other relevant metrics. This can help identify patterns or similarities between different teams.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n",
    "   import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Select relevant features for clustering\n",
    "   X = team_performance_filtered[['ATS Wins After Loss', 'ATS Losses After Loss', 'Win Percentage']]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Perform KMeans clustering\n",
    "   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Add cluster labels to the dataframe\n",
    "   team_performance_filtered['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Visualize clusters\n",
    "   sns.scatterplot(data=team_performance_filtered, x='ATS Wins After Loss', y='Win Percentage', hue='Cluster')\n",
    "   plt.title('Cluster Analysis of ATS Performance After Losses')\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Analysis**: This clustering can reveal underlying patterns, grouping teams with similar performance profiles. It may uncover teams that behave similarly, which can be insightful for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Win Percentage Distribution Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Instead of focusing only on the top and bottom teams, you can perform **distribution analysis** of all teams' ATS win percentages after losses. This would help you see whether performance after losses follows a normal distribution or has outliers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sns.histplot(team_performance_filtered['Win Percentage'], kde=True)\n",
    "   plt.title('Distribution of ATS Win Percentages After Losses')\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Analysis**: This visualization can reveal whether certain teams are outliers in terms of performance, and how tightly packed the majority of teams are around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Explore Time Lag Effects**:\n",
    "   - Investigate if the amount of time between games impacts ATS performance after a loss. You could calculate the number of days between games and analyze whether teams with more rest are better at covering the spread.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df_filtered['Rest Days'] = (pd.to_datetime(df_filtered['Next Game Date']) - pd.to_datetime(df_filtered['Game Date'])).dt.days\n",
    "   rest_performance = df_filtered.groupby('Rest Days').mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "   sns.lineplot(data=rest_performance, x='Rest Days', y='Win Percentage')\n",
    "   plt.title('ATS Win Percentage After Loss by Rest Days')\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Analysis**: This will reveal how teams perform after varying amounts of rest, showing if more rest improves performance ATS after losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches offer more detailed and layered insights, helping you find trends that go beyond simple win-loss records. By combining these methods, you can analyze teams' performance under various conditions and identify unique patterns that offer deeper value."
