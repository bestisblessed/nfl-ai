    "### Key Metrics for the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Recent Form**: A player's performance trend over recent weeks—whether they’re in a scoring slump or a hot streak.\n",
    "   - **Historical TD Scoring Rate**: The frequency with which a player scores touchdowns in past games.\n",
    "   - **Red Zone Targets**: Number of times a player is targeted in the red zone, where TD scoring opportunities are higher.\n",
    "   - **Yards Per Carry/Reception**: Efficiency metrics that show how many yards a player gains on average per carry or reception.\n",
    "   - **Touch Rate**: The percentage of plays in which the player is involved (e.g., carries, targets).\n",
    "   - **Injury Status**: Whether the player is fully healthy, playing through an injury, or recently recovered.\n",
    "   - **Team's Red Zone Efficiency**: How often the team converts red zone visits into touchdowns.\n",
    "   - **Defensive Line Strength**: Metrics like defensive line grades, which can impact a running back's effectiveness.\n",
    "   - **Opponent's Defensive Strength**: How strong the opposing defense is, particularly in stopping the run or pass.\n",
    "   - **Opponent’s Red Zone Defense**: How well the opponent prevents touchdowns in the red zone.\n",
    "   - **Defensive Adjustments**: The opponent's tendency to double-cover key players or adjust schemes for specific matchups.\n",
    "   - **Weather/Situational Adjustments**: Expected flow of the game—whether a team is likely to be in a pass-heavy or run-heavy situation due to being ahead or behind.\n",
    "   - **Home vs. Away**: Players might perform differently based on whether they’re playing at home or away.\n",
    "   - **Expected Points Added (EPA)**: How much a player contributes to the team's scoring opportunities.\n",
    "   - **Player Usage Rate in High-Leverage Situations**: How often the player is used in critical game situations, like third downs or within the 5-yard line.\n",
    "   - **Game Pace**: The number of plays run per game by both teams, which can influence opportunities.\n",
    "   - **Intangible Factors**: This could include things like a player’s motivation (e.g., playing against a former team), team morale, or locker room dynamics.\n"
