## Models & Code Overview

### Purpose
- **Scope**: Three XGBoost-based props model families (Passing, Receiving, Rushing) produce per-game PNG/TXT assets and CSVs. A master script compiles all into final TXT/HTML/CSV.
- **Inputs**: `Scrapers/data/all_passing_rushing_receiving.csv`, `Scrapers/data/rosters/roster_2025.csv`, repo files `starting_qbs_2025.csv`, `upcoming_games.csv`.
- **One-shot run**: `bash gen_final_report.sh WEEK` (W=1â€“18).

### 1-PASSING-YARDS (QB passing yards)
- **Runners**: `prepare_data.py`, `xgboost_passing_yards_qb.py`, `generate_txt_reports.py`, `generate_html_reports.py`.
- **Model**: XGBRegressor on rolling means of attempts/completions/yards (windows 3/5/8); restricted to starting QBs.
- **Outputs**: `1-PASSING-YARDS/predictions-week-W-QB/`
  - `final_weekW_QB_pass_yards_report.csv`
  - Per-game PNGs (full and cleaned), TXT; merged TXT/HTML

### 2-RECEIVING-YARDS (WR, RB, TE)
- **Runners**: `xgboost_receiving_yards_wr.py`, `xgboost_receiving_yards_rb.py`, `xgboost_receiving_yards_te.py`, then TXT/HTML generators.
- **Model(s)**: XGB on rolling means of targets/receptions/rec_yards (3/5/8/12) + rolling medians + baseline features (last-3 avg, prior-season avg, career median). Uses `reg:absoluteerror` objective. No placeholders for players without history.
- **Outputs**: `2-RECEIVING-YARDS/predictions-week-W-{WR|RB|TE}/`
  - `final_weekW_{POS}_rec_yards_report.csv`
  - Per-game PNGs (full and cleaned), TXT; merged TXT/HTML

### 3-RUSHING-YARDS (QB, RB)
- **Runners**: `xgboost_rushing_yards_qb.py`, `xgboost_rushing_yards_rb.py`, then TXT/HTML generators.
- **Model(s)**: XGB on rolling means of rush_attempts/rush_yds (3/5/8/12) + rolling medians + baseline features (last-3 avg, prior-season avg, career median). Uses `reg:absoluteerror` objective. QB variant: only starting QBs; rookies flagged "No Data".
- **Outputs**: `3-RUSHING-YARDS/predictions-week-W-{QB|RB}/`
  - `final_weekW_{POS}_rush_yards_report.csv`
  - Per-game PNGs (full and cleaned), TXT; merged TXT/HTML

### Orchestration
- **`gen_final_report.sh`**: Cleans week outputs, runs all three runners, then executes combiner.
- **`generate_final_report.py`**: Loads per-model CSVs, tags `prop_type`/`position`, groups by game using `upcoming_games.csv` (fallback to pairs from data), and writes:
  - `0-FINAL-REPORTS/weekW_complete_props_report.txt` and `.html`
  - `0-FINAL-REPORTS/weekW_all_props_summary.csv`

### Quick start
1. Ensure inputs exist: `Scrapers/data/all_passing_rushing_receiving.csv`, `Scrapers/data/rosters/roster_2025.csv`; update `upcoming_games.csv`, `starting_qbs_2025.csv`.
2. Run: `bash gen_final_report.sh WEEK`.
3. Open: `0-FINAL-REPORTS/weekW_complete_props_report.html` and `weekW_all_props_summary.csv`.
