# NFL Power Ranking and Betting Line Generation Design

## 1. Power Ranking Model: Elo-like System

### 1.1. Initial Rating
All teams will start with a base Elo rating of 1500.

### 1.2. Game Outcome and Rating Update
After each game, team ratings will be updated based on the game's outcome (win/loss) and the pre-game rating difference between the two teams. The update formula will be a modified Elo system that incorporates point differential.

### 1.3. Point Differential Integration
To account for the margin of victory/defeat, the actual score difference will influence the magnitude of the rating change. A larger win margin against a stronger opponent will result in a greater rating increase.

### 1.4. K-factor
A K-factor will be used to determine the maximum possible rating adjustment from a single game. This value can be tuned for optimal performance.

## 2. Betting Line Generation

### 2.1. Converting Power Rankings to Point Spreads
The difference in Elo ratings between two teams will be converted into a point spread. This conversion will likely involve a linear relationship, where a certain rating difference corresponds to a specific point spread.

### 2.2. Home-Field Advantage
A fixed or dynamic home-field advantage (HFA) will be added to the home team's point spread. This accounts for the statistical advantage teams have when playing at home.

### 2.3. Incorporating Vig (Vigorish/Juice)
Once the raw point spread is determined, American betting odds will be generated by applying a vig. This ensures that the implied probabilities of all outcomes sum to more than 100%, reflecting real-world sportsbook practices. The odds will be calculated such that for a favorite, the odds are negative (e.g., -110), and for an underdog, the odds are positive (e.g., +110).
